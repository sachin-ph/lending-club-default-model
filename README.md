Loan Default Prediction Model - Lending Club

This model is built to predict the borrowers who will default on their microfinancing loan based on features within their application. Loan data is from Lending club, a peer to peer fintech platform that connects those looking to provide capital as an investment, and those who need short term liquidity.
